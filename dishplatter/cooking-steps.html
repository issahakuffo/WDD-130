                    <h2 class="steps"> Banku</h2>
                    <p>
                        <b>Ingredients :</b> Corn dough and Cassava dough<br>
                        <b>Step :</b>
                        First, put the corn and cassava dough into a sauce-pan and mix them together with 
                        a reasonable amount of water. Mix it until the mixture is smooth and thick. Set the
                        fire and put the sauce pan on the fire, then start stirring. Keep stirring until it 
                        soilidifies gradually, and then, with a firm arm, turn the solid mixture over and over. 
                        Water is added for the first time after fifteen minutes of turning the banku over and 
                        over, and then the banku is left in the water to boil without turning the food. 
                        The banku will be turned after five minutes until the food is ready to taste and dish out. 
                        It is usually served with okro stew, shito, groundnut, or palmnut soup.

                        <b>Ingredients:</b> Rice and Beans <br>
                        <b>Steps : </b>
                        The beans are washed thoroughly before being set on fire with lacal herbs to give them
                        flavor and color. The beans will be on the fire for about an hour before adding the rice 
                        to the beans so they can cook together. After the rice has been added to the beans at a
                        lower temperature, the wakye will be stirred regularly to ensure an even mixture and 
                        texture, while the wakye is covered with aluminum foil. That is how easily wakye can be made, 
                        and it is usually served with a black hot sauce called shito, tomato sauce, spaghetti, and gari.

                        <b>Ingredients:</b> fresh tomatoes, tomato paste, seasoning, fresh pepper, onion, garlic, ginger,
                        carrot, and rice. <br>
                        <b>Steps : </b>
                        Blend fresh tomatoes, onions, garlic, and ginger separately. Sauce-pan is set on fire, 
                        and a reasonable amount of cooking oil is added. A blended onion is then poured into the
                        hot oil to cook for a few minutes before adding tomato paste. The mixture is allowed to 
                        fry for about five minutes in white stirring, then blended with tomatoes, garlic, and

                        little water is added as well. While the food is on fire, the temperature of the fire 
                        is regulated to the lowest to prevent it from burning, and the sauce-pan is covered with
                        aluminum foil to help maintain the constant temperature., and gari.
