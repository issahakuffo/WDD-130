                    <p class="food-history">
                        Jollof rice s a very popular dish in Ghana; according to sauce, 
                        it originated in Senegal, and it is now prepared  across the country
                        by all the ethnic groups in Ghana with multiple recipes and methods
                        for making it. However, so far, no ethinic group in Ghana has claimed
                        or challenged its orignation becuase jollof rice taste differently in 
                        regards ingredients and recipes.

                    <p class="food-history">
                        Waakye is usually eaten by Ghanaians as breakfast and is normally unique 
                        and prepared by the Hausa who migrated to Ghana. The main ingredients used are rice and beans. 
                        Due to its popularity, it has been adapted by almost all the ethnic groups in Ghana.
                        Fufu, originally unique to the Akan ethnic group, is made from cassava and plantains
                        as the main ingredients and is normally eaten with soup. Fufu is one of the most 
                        popular Ghanaian dishes, and all other ethnic groups prepare it now.

                    <p class="food-history">
                        While Ghanaian dishes are unique to each ethnic group, others are also common among the 
                        ethnic groups. Banku and kenkey (Ga kenkey) are unique to the Ga Adamgbe ethnic groups;
                        these dishes are prepared using corn dough as an ingredient. The Fanti tribe also has 
                        kenkey (Fanti kenkey) as their unique dish, but it is made using a different method and
                        material;  however, they use the same ingredient as the Ga kenkey.
