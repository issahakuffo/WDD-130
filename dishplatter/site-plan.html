        <b>Brief History About Ghana </b> <br>
        <br>
        Ghana has a rich and lengthy history that spans several centuries. Ghana, a country 
        located in West Africa, is renowned for its stunning beaches, verdant rainforests, 
        and energetic towns. There are more than 100 different ethnic groups in the nation, 
        and they all have distinctive traditions and practices. It's critical to comprehend 
        Ghana's past in order to fully appreciate its vibrant culture and society.  As part of
        their race for control of Africa, the British conquered Ghana in the late 19th century.
        Its substantial gold reserves earned the nation the nickname "Gold Coast." The economy,
        society, and culture of Ghana saw substantial transformations during the colonial era.
        Culturally and socially, the country was greatly impacted by the introduction of Christianity
        and Western education by the British. Ghana is a nation that is currently experiencing 
        tremendous social and economic transformation. Over the past few decades, Ghana's economy 
        has expanded quickly, with a particular emphasis on the development of its mining, petroleum,
        and agriculture sectors.

        <b>Most Popular Ghanaian Dishes</b> <br>
        <br>
        Ghana has more than 100 ethnic groups, and each ethnic group has its own unique dishes.
        However, due to migration within Ghana and civilization, popular ones among Ghanaians 
        such as waakye, fufu, and banku  have been made across all ethnic groups. Most cuisines
        use at least one tropical ingredient in their preparation because these foods are so 
        common: corn, beans, millet, plantains, cassava, spicy peppers, and tomatoes. A stew or
        soup with meat or beans is usually served with a starchy staple like plantains, corn dough, 
        or yams. Dishes such as Banku, Kenkey, Waakye, Jollof rice, Fufu, Beans with Plantains, Yam,
        Kelewele, and Tuo Zaafi are the most popular foods in the country, while dishes like Wasawasa, 
        Apepremsah, Bambara bean (Aboboi), and others are less popular dishes.

      <h3>Dishes</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Ghanaian Dishes and Its Origin</b><br>
        <br>
        While Ghanaian dishes are unique to each ethnic group, others are also common among the 
        ethnic groups. Banku and kenkey (Ga kenkey) are unique to the Ga Adamgbe ethnic groups;
        these dishes are prepared using corn dough as an ingredient. The Fanti tribe also has 
        kenkey (Fanti kenkey) as their unique dish, but it is made using a different method and
        material;  however, they use the same ingredient as the Ga kenkey. Fufu, originally unique
        to the Akan ethnic group, is made from cassava and plantains as the main ingredients and is 
        normally eaten with soup. Fufu is one of the most popular Ghanaian dishes, and all other ethnic 
        groups prepare it now. Waakye is usually eaten by Ghanaians as breakfast and is normally unique 
        and prepared by the Hausa who migrated to Ghana. The main ingredients used are rice and beans. 
        Due to its popularity, it has been adapted by almost all the ethnic groups in Ghana. Jollof rice 
        is a very popular dish in Ghana; according to sauce, it originated in Senegal, and it is now prepared 
        across the country by all the ethnic groups in Ghana with multiple recipes and methods for making it.

      <h3>How To Make Dishes</h3>
      <p>
        <b>How to Prepare Ghanaian Dishes</b><br>
        <br>
        There are many methods and recipes regarding how food is prepared in Ghana. Sometimes ingredients may
        differ,but the end product will be good and taste delicious. We will provide guidelines on how to make
        some popular Ghanaian dishes. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Jollof Rice</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>Ingredients:</b> fresh tomatoes, tomato paste, seasoning, fresh pepper, onion, garlic, ginger, carrot, and rice. 
        <br>
        <b>Steps:</b>
        Blend fresh tomatoes, onions, garlic, and ginger separately. Sauce-pan is set on fire, and a reasonable amount
        of cooking oil is added. A blended onion is then poured into the hot oil to cook for a few minutes before 
        adding tomato paste. The mixture is allowed to fry for about five minutes in white stirring, then blended with
        tomatoes, garlic, and ginger in the sauce-pan before topping it up with seasoning. Salt is added and tasted. 
        After about ten minutes, rice is added to the tomato sauce after washing, and then a little water is added as well. 
        While the food is on fire, the temperature of the fire is regulated to the lowest to prevent it from burning, 
        and the sauce-pan is covered with aluminum foil to help maintain the constant temperature.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b> Banku</b><br>
       <br>
       <b>Ingredients</b> Corn dough and Cassava dough
       <br>
       <b>Step:</b>
       First, put the corn and cassava dough into a sauce-pan and mix them together with a reasonable amount of water. 
       Mix it until the mixture is smooth and thick. Set the fire and put the sauce pan on the fire, then start stirring. 
       Keep stirring until it soilidifies gradually, and then, with a firm arm, turn the solid mixture over and over. 
       Water is added for the first time after fifteen minutes of turning the banku over and over, and then the banku 
       is left in the water to boil without turning the food. The banku will be turned after five minutes until the 
       food is ready to taste and dish out. It is usually served with okro stew, shito, groundnut, or palmnut soup.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>Waakye</b> <br>
       <br>
       <b>Ingredients:</b> Rice and Beans <br>
       <b>Steps : </b>
       The beans are washed thoroughly before being set on fire with lacal herbs to give them flavor and color. 
       The beans will be on the fire for about an hour before adding the rice to the beans so they can cook together. 
       After the rice has been added to the beans at a lower temperature, the wakye will be stirred regularly to ensure 
       an even mixture and texture, while the wakye is covered with aluminum foil. That is how easily wakye can be made, 
       and it is usually served with a black hot sauce called shito, tomato sauce, spaghetti, and gari.
