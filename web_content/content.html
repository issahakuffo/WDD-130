        <h2>Vincent Van Gogh</h2>
        <p>
            Vincent Van Gogh‘s paintings are adored around the world. His unique post-impressionist 
            technique, with swathing brushstrokes and striking colors, is instantly recognizable.

        <p>While alive, the artist’s work was not so well received and he sold very few of his paintings. 
           He became posthumously celebrated and now he is one of the most famous painters ever to have 
           lived, with his original artworks selling for millions. Some of Van Gogh’s most expensive 
           paintings include the Portrait de l’artiste sans barbe (1889) which sold for $71.5 million in 
           1998 and Portrait du Docteur Gachet (1890) which sold for $82.5 million in 1990. While many 
           original Van Gogh paintings are scattered around the world’s greatest museums and private 
           collections, many of them now sit in the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam.

        <h2>The Most Famous Paintings by Vincent Van Gogh</h2>
        <p>An incredibly prolific artist – although much of his work was created in the last 10 years 
            of his life – Van Gogh produced around 2000 artworks during his lifetime, and each carries 
            with it a special part of the artist’s legacy. Here is a selection of his most famous paintings.
        </p>
        <p><b>Starry Night, 1889</b><br>
            Van Gogh’s painting Starry Night (1889), is one of his most iconic. Leading up to this point, 
            Van Gogh had been suffering from mental health issues, so much so that it led to him cutting 
            off his left ear. After this incident, in 1888 he was admitted to the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole 
            asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence to recover. The view that we see in Starry Night is actually 
            inspired by the view that Van Gogh saw from his bedroom in the asylum. The swirling blues of 
            the moonlit night sky have become synonymous with the artist’s style and the emotional quality 
            of his use of color. </p>

        <p><b>Sunflowers, 1889</b><br>
            During his time in Arles, South of France, in the years 1888-89, Van Gogh created five paintings 
            of sunflowers in a vase, using only shades of yellow and a touch of green. He wrote that for him 
            sunflowers represented “gratitude” and so hung one of them in his home. Later, his friend and fellow 
            artist Paul Gaugin, while living with him for a short while, said that he very much liked the works 
            and asked Van Gogh for one of the paintings, which he was given. Today, this copy sits in the Van 
            Gogh Museum in Amsterdam.

        <p> <b>Self-Portrait, 1889</b><br>
            Van Gogh painted many self-portraits during the course of his career, no fewer than 35. The one 
            displayed below, painted in 1889, is one of his most famous. Van Gogh depicted himself wearing what 
            he used to work in – his blue jacket and shirt. In an attempt to be as true to himself as possible, 
            he depicts his sharp features, the furrow in his brow, and the striking red tones of his hair and beard. 
            This is one of the final self-portraits he painted before his death the following year.
